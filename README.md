# CoreJavaStandAloneShoppingApp
A java console shopping app.

This project uses ANSI codes to clear the screen, and if they aren't supported on your system then one options is to change 'com.shoppingapp.utilityConsoleExtras.ANSI_CLEAR' to be equal to "\n\n\n" in order to space out different menus.

Additionally, a local memory dao is used, and by default it has 3 items and a test user with an old and current invoice. The test user is TestUser with password TestPassword.
